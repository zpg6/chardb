# chardb

## Code
- Tight and fast. Fewer lines, fewer allocations, fewer branches.
- Self-documenting. Make illegal states unrepresentable; encode invariants in types, not checks.
- Comments only for what the code cannot say. No restating the obvious.
- No leftover files: no temp files, build output, scratch scripts, or stray docs.
- Tests cover the change and would fail if it broke. A test that passes without exercising the behavior is worse than none.

## Git
- Branches: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`, `docs/...`, `test/...`.
- Commits: short conventional style. `fix: fence recovery on stale lease`. No agent `Co-Authored-By` trailers.
- Pull `main` before branching.

## PRs
- Small, focused, few files. PRs touching many files get closed unread. Don't split one change into many PRs either; pick the natural unit.
- Never close and recreate a PR over a branch name or trailer. Leave the name. Amend and force-push if the commits need fixing.
- Description says what changed and why in a few lines, then proves it works. Prefer a small table of numbers or a before/after metric over prose. No diagrams.
- Preferred PRs: tighten, speed up, simplify, delete, or fix code that doesn't do what it was clearly meant to do.
- Docs and landing page change only when the code change requires it. Most PRs touch neither.
